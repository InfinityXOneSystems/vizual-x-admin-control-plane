🔎 ChatGPT → GitHub
⚙️ Automated writes/PRs
🚀 Workflow dispatch
📣 Runner execution
📊 Status reporting
📱 Natural-language invocation

☑️ Custom Integrations Required (Full Operational Pipeline)
1) GitHub Connector Integration (Read-Only)

Purpose:
Enables ChatGPT to read repo contents and analyze code in context.

Requirements:

OAuth authorization from user

Repository read access

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ View code files
✔ Search repository
✔ Summarize content

Limitations:
✖ Does not allow writing
✖ Does not trigger workflows

OpenAI spec:
Standard GitHub Connector built into ChatGPT UI (Settings → Apps).

2) GitHub App Integration (OAuth, Write Permissions)

Purpose:
Enables secure automation with GitHub that ChatGPT can initiate indirectly.

Requirements:

GitHub App installed on repo

Permissions configured:

contents: read + write

pull requests: read + write

statuses: write

workflows: read + write (optional)

checks: write

commits: write

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Create/modify files via API
✔ Create/update pull requests
✔ Create/close branches
✔ Provide commit statuses
✔ Guardrail enforcement

Essential for:

Writing pipeline changes

Status checks reporting

Autonomy execution

OpenAI spec:
Works with external API calls generated by ChatGPT or middleware.

3) Automated GitHub API Integration (PAT/Apps)

Purpose:
Allows a backend to execute on behalf of GPT outputs.

Requirements:

Personal Access Token (PAT) or GitHub App private key

Token stored securely

Token with write scopes

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Push commits
✔ Create branches
✔ Create Pull Requests
✔ Update issues / statuses
✔ Trigger workflows (via dispatch)

Used by:

Middleware microservice

Serverless functions

Notes:
ChatGPT cannot directly call this API — you need an adapter.

4) Workflow Dispatch API Integration

Purpose:
Triggers workflows (CI / pipeline runs) via API events.

Requirements:

GitHub Actions workflow configured to accept workflow_dispatch

GitHub App or PAT authentication

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Manual pipeline trigger
✔ Natural-language → pipeline launch
✔ Custom event-based automation

Example event trigger:

POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/dispatches

5) Runner Execution Integration

Purpose:
Your self-hosted or GitHub-hosted runner executes validation, governance, and pipeline logic.

Requirements:

Runner registered with repository

Runner online and accepted by GitHub

Runner labels match workflow constraints

Necessary scripts present in repo

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Execute PowerShell/Python scripts
✔ Validate and report pipeline status
✔ Upload artifacts

Notes:
ChatGPT does not execute runners — the workflow does.

6) Checks/Status API Integration

Purpose:
Reports pipeline and validation results back to the repository interface.

Requirements:

GitHub Checks API access via GitHub App or PAT

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Pass/fail status per commit
✔ Detailed logs
✔ Gate violations
✔ Line-level context

Used for:

PR blocking

Status badges

Automated feedback

7) Webhooks/Event Subscription Integration

Purpose:
Listens for external events (e.g., workflow completion).

Requirements:

GitHub webhook configured

HTTPS endpoint to receive events

Handler to parse results

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Pipeline run feedback
✔ Real-time status updates
✔ ChatGPT exposure of results

Example events:

workflow_run

check_run

pull_request

8) Natural-Language Trigger Adapter (Middleware)

Purpose:
Translates GPT natural language (e.g., “Rehydrate”) to actionable API calls.

Requirements:

Serverless Lambda / Express API

Auth integration (GitHub App / PAT)

Security validation

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Accept voice / text request
✔ Map to predefined commands
✔ Validate intent + scope
✔ Dispatch workflow via API

9) Secure Secrets Management Integration

Purpose:
Handles sensitive auth tokens without exposing them.

Requirements:

Vault, environment secrets, or cloud KMS

Bound to middleware

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Store GitHub App keys
✔ Store PAT securely
✔ Rotate credentials

10) Audit and Immutable Logging Integration

Purpose:
Logs all GPT-initiated actions immutably.

Requirements:

JSON-based audit store (immutable)

Git commits or external log service

Capabilities Enabled:
✔ Traceability
✔ Compliance
✔ Rollback auditing

🔑 What Is Required for Operational GPT → GitHub Execution

To accomplish natural-language pipeline operation, you need all of the following:

GitHub Connector — for reading

GitHub App — for queriable write access and status updates

API Adapter — to execute GPT-generated write actions

Workflow Dispatch Integration — for pipeline triggers

Runner Registration — for pipeline execution

Checks/Status Updates — for feedback

Webhook Receiver — for real-time status

Secrets Storage — for secure auth

Audit Logging — for immutability

Natural Language Adapter — translates GPT commands
into API actions (voice / text)

🧠 Why Each Integration Exists
🔹 GitHub Connector

Only for read. No side effects.

🔹 GitHub App

For authenticated write + status.

🔹 PAT/API Adapter

So GPT can cause real change. Connector alone won’t do it.

🔹 Workflow Dispatch

Workflows are what actually run runners and scripts.

🔹 Runner

Executes your verification & pipeline logic.

🔹 Checks & Webhooks

Provide feedback into GitHub and chat.

🔹 Middleware

Bridges the gap between language and execution.

Summary

To achieve the end-to-end pipeline you want — where saying “Rehydrate” triggers a full pipeline execution and returns a valid system state — you need:

📌 1. GitHub Read (GitHub Connector)
📌 2. GitHub Write (GitHub App)
📌 3. API Adapter + Secrets
📌 4. Workflow Dispatch
📌 5. Runner Execution
📌 6. Status/Checks Integration
📌 7. Webhook Listener
📌 8. Natural Language Adapter
📌 9. Immutable Audit
📌 10. Secure Tokens Store
